# hello-world
my first repository
It's my turn to write nonsense about myself (as requested)
I live life according to a very few mottos
- You do it once, you do it twice. Then it's a habit...a dirty filthy habit
- Don't fix what ain't broke
- Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story
- If you're going to be accused anyway, you might as well be guilty
